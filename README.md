The application uses :
- The "VB Cable" driver to redirect the sound in other applications (like Skype, TeamSpeak ...)
- The [Metro Framework](https://github.com/viperneo/winforms-modernui) by [Sven Walter](https://github.com/viperneo)
- [NAudio](http://naudio.codeplex.com/)

ChangeLog
---------

1.4.0
Added the option to set a toggle key which prevents the key detect (usefull to avoid playing songs when typing, for example).
Resized the window.

1.3.0
Added the option to import and save the used songs in a configuration file.

1.2.0
Added the option to choose the sounds volume with a trackbar.

1.1.0
Added the option to hear the sounds on the main headphones.

1.0.0
First release.

TODO
---------

- Make a key (chosen by the user) which cancels temporarily the key detector. This prevents playing the sounds when the user is typing in a chat game, for example.
- The sound names must be showed as non-absolute links.
