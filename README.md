IlshiPlay
=========

A VB .NET tool which plays a sound when an associated key is pressed. This software is under the MIT License.
The application uses :
- The "VB Cable" driver to redirect the sound in other applications (like Skype, TeamSpeak ...)
- The [Metro Framework](https://github.com/viperneo/winforms-modernui) by [Sven Walter](https://github.com/viperneo)
- [NAudio](http://naudio.codeplex.com/)

- UnRAR the file with [WinRAR](http://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=10)

ChangeLog
---------

1.3.0
Added the option to import and save the used songs in a configuration file.

1.2.0
Added the option to choose the sounds volume with a trackbar.

1.1.0
Added the option to hear the sounds on the main headphones.

1.0.0

TODO
---------

- Make a key (chosen by the user) which cancels temporarily the key detector. This prevents playing the sounds when the user is typing in a chat game, for example.
- The sound names must be showed as non-absolute links.
